# About Dietrich Epp Schmidt

I'm an ecologist that studies agricultural systems. My topical specialization is in soil microbial communities and their responses to land use. I primarily use R for scripting and data analysis.

## Background

My research focuses on understanding how agricultural practices impact soil microbial communities and how these communities, in turn, affect plant health and productivity. Through my work, I aim to develop practical tools and frameworks that help farmers make informed decisions about soil health management.

## Research Interests

- Soil microbial ecology
- Agricultural systems
- Land use impacts on microbial communities
- Metabarcoding and whole-genome sequencing
- Statistical methods for microbiome research

## CV
