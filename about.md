## Personal Interests

As a practicing agro-ecologist, my focus is on building self sustaining ecosystems that provide high value economic off-takes while supporting robust ecosystem function. For me, producing local genoty[...]

I enjoy cooking freshly harvested food and sharing the harvest with of good friends around a campfire. I'm also an avid forager of berries and wild mushrooms, and often find myself most at peace in th[...]

  <summary>Components of N-fixation system response to glyphosate are un-coupled in agroecosystems</summary>
Glyphosate, introduced 50 years ago, is one of the most widely used herbicides. There are lingering concerns over the potential environmental impacts of glyphosate, prompting many studies. Many of the[...]

  <summary>Soil microbiomes in three farming systems more affected by depth than farming system</summary>
Agriculture, by its intentional design, manipulates the ecological functions of soils. It does so by altering carbon and nutrient inputs; by controlling the plant community; and in the case of tillage[...]

<details>
  <summary>Soil microbial communities in diverse agroecosystems exposed to the herbicide glyphosate</summary>
Despite glyphosate’s wide use for weed control in agriculture, questions remain about the herbicide’s effect on soil microbial communities. The existing scientific literature contains conflicting [...]

  <summary>Metagenomics reveals bacterial and archaeal adaptation to urban land-use: N catabolism, methanogenesis, and nutrient acquisition</summary>
Urbanization results in the systemic conversion of land-use, driving habitat and biodiversity loss. The “urban convergence hypothesis” posits that urbanization represents a merging of habitat char[...]

<details>
  <summary>Urbanization leads to the loss of ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity and the convergence of archaeal and fungal soil communities</summary>
Urbanization alters the physicochemical environment, introduces non-native species and causes ecosystem characteristics to converge. It has been speculated that these alterations contribute to loss of[...]
