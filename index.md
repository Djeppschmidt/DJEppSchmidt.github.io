# Applied Ecology & Data Solutions for Soil, Microbiomes, and Environmental Research
Transforming complex biological data into reproducible insights, actionable models, and sustainable solutions

## What I Do

I provide hands-on technical consulting for environmental researchers, NGOs, and industry teams. Leveraging expertise in scientific programming, soil and microbiome data interpretation, and carbon modeling, I translate raw ecological data into reproducible workflows, robust models, and actionable insights. My approach emphasizes efficiency, transparency, and sustainability, helping teams meet project goals without reinventing the technical foundation.

## How It Works

<b>Step 1:</b> Initial Consultation – Discuss project goals and constraints.
&nbsp;
<b>Step 2:</b> Scope & Proposal – Define deliverables, timeline, and fee structure.
&nbsp;
<b>Step 3:</b> Project Execution – Implement analysis, modeling, or consultation services.
&nbsp;
<b>Step 4:</b> Delivery & Review – Provide actionable results, reproducible scripts, and documentation.
